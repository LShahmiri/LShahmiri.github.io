This project presents an end-to-end computer vision pipeline for detecting, analysing, and visualising glacier calving events using time-lapse imagery.  
The study focuses on Hansbreen Glacier (Svalbard, 2016) and demonstrates how automated image differencing combined with spatial analytics can reveal calving dynamics at scale.

## Project Overview

### Context

Glacier calving is a critical process affecting glacier mass balance and sea-level rise.  
Manual annotation of calving events from time-lapse imagery is time-consuming and subjective.

This project explores whether **automated image differencing** and **data-driven spatial analysis** can be used to detect and characterise calving events at scale.

### Objective

- Detect calving events automatically from sequential images  
- Quantify event size and location  
- Analyse spatial and temporal patterns  
- Infer calving styles using interpretable rules  
- Provide interactive visual exploration tools

## Data & Image Acquisition

Time-lapse images were collected from a fixed camera observing Hansbreen Glacier throughout 2016.  
Images were organised by month, with consistent camera geometry and resolution.

Each image filename contains a timestamp, enabling precise temporal alignment.

## Calving Event Detection

Calving events were detected using **pairwise image differencing**:

1. Consecutive images were converted to grayscale and smoothed  
2. Absolute pixel-wise differences were computed  
3. Thresholding isolated significant changes  
4. Morphological filtering removed noise  
5. Connected components identified candidate calving events  

Each detected event was recorded with:
- Timestamp  
- Pixel area (event magnitude proxy)  
- Spatial centroid (x, y)

## Exploratory Analytics Dashboard

An interactive dashboard was built to explore the detected events:

- Event frequency over time  
- Distribution of event sizes  
- Spatial distribution of event centroids  
- Filtering by month and minimum event size  

This allowed rapid quality control and high-level pattern discovery.

## Spatial Heatmaps & Seasonal Patterns

To visualise calving intensity, spatial heatmaps were generated by accumulating event centroids over a reference image.

- High-density zones highlight persistent calving fronts  
- Heatmaps reveal non-uniform spatial behaviour  

Seasonal comparison showed clear differences between **spring** and **summer**, with increased activity and spatial spread during warmer months.

## Rule-Based Calving Style Classification

A transparent, rule-based system was introduced to infer calving styles based on:

- Event size (pixel area percentiles)  
- Vertical position relative to the estimated waterline  

Events were classified into:
- Icefall  
- Waterline calving  
- Submarine calving  
- Sheet collapse  

This approach prioritised **interpretability** over black-box modelling.

## Key Results

- Over **500,000** calving-related change events detected  
- Strong spatial clustering along the glacier terminus  
- Clear seasonal intensification during summer months  
- Rule-based classification provided physically interpretable insights  

This demonstrates that simple, explainable computer vision methods can scale to large environmental datasets.

## Growth & Next Steps

Potential extensions include:

- Optical flow or deep learning–based motion estimation  
- Physical calibration from pixels to real-world units  
- Integration with meteorological and oceanographic data  
- Validation against manually annotated calving inventories
