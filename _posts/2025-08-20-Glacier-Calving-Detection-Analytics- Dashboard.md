This project presents an end-to-end computer vision pipeline for detecting, analysing, and visualising glacier calving events using time-lapse imagery.  
The study focuses on Hansbreen Glacier (Svalbard, 2016) and demonstrates how automated image differencing combined with spatial analytics can reveal calving dynamics at scale.

## Dataset Description

This project uses high-frequency time-lapse imagery of the Hansbreen glacier terminus in Svalbard, collected as part of a long-term glaciological monitoring program operated by the Polish Polar Station (PPS).

Images were acquired between 17 May and 31 October 2016 using a Canon EOS 1100D camera (4272 × 2848 pixels, 18 mm focal length), with a nominal temporal resolution of 15 minutes. The system was powered by a solar-assisted energy supply, enabling extended autonomous operation in Arctic conditions.

Due to the challenging polar environment, the dataset exhibits several real-world complexities, including irregular temporal gaps, variable illumination conditions (fog, sun glare, polar night), and occasional camera shifts or tilt changes. These characteristics reflect realistic constraints commonly encountered in environmental monitoring applications.

Prior to analysis, images with insufficient visibility were removed, camera misalignments were manually corrected, and the glacier terminus region was cropped for focused analysis. The calving front was further divided into spatial zones to facilitate the investigation of spatial variability in calving activity.

Overall, this dataset is well suited for event-based image analysis, change detection, and spatio-temporal modelling of natural processes under realistic observational constraints.

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Context

Glacier calving is a critical process affecting glacier mass balance and sea-level rise.  
Manual annotation of calving events from time-lapse imagery is time-consuming and subjective.

This project explores whether **automated image differencing** and **data-driven spatial analysis** can be used to detect and characterise calving events at scale.

### 1.2 Objective

- Detect calving events automatically from sequential images  
- Quantify event size and location  
- Analyse spatial and temporal patterns  
- Infer calving styles using interpretable rules  
- Provide interactive visual exploration tools

## 2. Data & Image Acquisition

Time-lapse images were collected from a fixed camera observing Hansbreen Glacier throughout 2016.  
Images were organised by month, with consistent camera geometry and resolution.

Each image filename contains a timestamp, enabling precise temporal alignment.

## 3. Calving Event Detection

Calving events were detected using **pairwise image differencing**:

1. Consecutive images were converted to grayscale and smoothed  
2. Absolute pixel-wise differences were computed  
3. Thresholding isolated significant changes  
4. Morphological filtering removed noise  
5. Connected components identified candidate calving events  

Each detected event was recorded with:
- Timestamp  
- Pixel area (event magnitude proxy)  
- Spatial centroid (x, y)

## 4. Exploratory Analytics Dashboard

An interactive dashboard was built to explore the detected events:

- Event frequency over time  
- Distribution of event sizes  
- Spatial distribution of event centroids  
- Filtering by month and minimum event size  

This allowed rapid quality control and high-level pattern discovery.

## 5. Spatial Heatmaps & Seasonal Patterns

To visualise calving intensity, spatial heatmaps were generated by accumulating event centroids over a reference image.

- High-density zones highlight persistent calving fronts  
- Heatmaps reveal non-uniform spatial behaviour  

Seasonal comparison showed clear differences between **spring** and **summer**, with increased activity and spatial spread during warmer months.

## 6. Rule-Based Calving Style Classification

A transparent, rule-based system was introduced to infer calving styles based on:

- Event size (pixel area percentiles)  
- Vertical position relative to the estimated waterline  

Events were classified into:
- Icefall  
- Waterline calving  
- Submarine calving  
- Sheet collapse  

This approach prioritised **interpretability** over black-box modelling.

## 7. Key Results

- Over **500,000** calving-related change events detected  
- Strong spatial clustering along the glacier terminus  
- Clear seasonal intensification during summer months  
- Rule-based classification provided physically interpretable insights  

This demonstrates that simple, explainable computer vision methods can scale to large environmental datasets.

## 8. Growth & Next Steps

Potential extensions include:

- Optical flow or deep learning–based motion estimation  
- Physical calibration from pixels to real-world units  
- Integration with meteorological and oceanographic data  
- Validation against manually annotated calving inventories
